I say... Hey Hey START DASH!!

### :warning: Users with photosensitive epilepsy are not suitable for this project.

## How do I use it? (Arduino UNO)
1. Connect your Adafruit NeoPixel(WS2812)'s data-in to your Arduino's Digital port 5.
2. (Optional)Connect a piezo or an electromagatic buzzer to port 3 for some notification sound and a weird startup chime.
3. Connect your Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display(SDA -> A4, SCL -> A5) for name display and brightness display.
4. Connect buttons to 9 for KEY_LEFT, 8 for KEY_SELECT, and 7 for KEY_RIGHT(low for pressdown)
5. Be the best caller in your group and try not to do anything that is not allowed for callers.
